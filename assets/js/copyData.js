Daydreampt solely in a meticulous mind while the body lodged itself in moving airplanes and cars, and in an attic in a large house on a cliff in the Northwest. </br></br> Interpol. Mew. The Most Serene Republic. A series of builds, swoops and falls and sharp turns, arriving leisurely and leaving in an instant. An audible business. </br></br> Familiarity and esotericism co-existing. Commercialism and mystery co-existing. Yearning and celebrating co-existing. </br></br> You must either manifest your own imagination or be enslaved by another. </br></br> You must create your own Network."
